OpenCollarUpdater Evolution
===========================

The most active channel in our project yet only managed by a single developer, Joy Stipe. Many of us went with earlier "evo" updates because those already had bugfixes we badly wanted to have. However 3.900 main and 3.9xx Dev/Beta/RC are for the greatest part based on new evolution code. Evolution versions 3.842 and greater are not yet compatible with the Owner Hud and the Sub AO and will require changes in the code for each specific gadget. If you prefer Firefox Aurora over main or beta, if you use nightly builds for most of your software - give evolution greater than v3.841 a whirl!
