Issue: 20130911.1

OpenCollar Dev/Beta/RC 3.923

Thank you for installing a beta version and helping us improve the collar!

MISSION GOALS

High priority: interface removal (Yes/No?); § or : or \\

Medium priority: appearance script still has pre-evolution artefacts; documentation for the touch feature

Low priority: compatibility for the Real Leash and Cage Home

IMPORTANT: What we are working on here will be the final version of the OpenCollar as we know it. Those who will want to participate for 4.0 will have to be familiar with the old system and you all have now one more time the chance to take a look at it from the inside out together with us.
