Issue: 20130831.1

OpenCollar Dev/Beta/RC 3.918

Thank you for installing a beta version and helping us improve the collar. This version is based in it's entirety on OpenCollar Evolution source, in all it's glory and with all the new challenges it brings.

High priority mission goals are to test the settings features (evolution defaults), try the new interface for attachments and learn how to regain full integration for Sub AO and Hud.

Medium priority mission goals are grooming the appearance script which still has pre-evolution artefacts and testing and exploring the touch feature.

Low priority mission goals are finding solutions and/or new ideas for the dying subspy plugin and restoring compatibility for the Real Leash and Cage Home plugins.

We will need your help to groom this one into a full release state and have been looking forward to make something happen again together as a community. Let's do it!
