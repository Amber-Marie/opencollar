Issue: 20130908.1

OpenCollar Dev/Beta/RC 3.922

Thank you for installing a beta version and helping us improve the collar. This version is based in it's entirety on OpenCollar Evolution source, in all it's glory and with all the new challenges it brings.

High priority: test settings features (evolution defaults); try the new interface; regain full integration for Sub AO and Hud

Medium priority: appearance script still has pre-evolution artefacts; explore and document the touch feature more

Low priority: ideas for the dying subspy plugin; compatibility for the Real Leash and Cage Home

IMPORTANT: What we are working on here will be the final version of the OpenCollar as we know it. Those who will want to participate for 4.0 will have to be familiar with the old system and you all have now one more time the chance to take a look at it from the inside out together with us.
