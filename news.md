We are close to a new main release and it's time to quadruple-check stuff:

1. settings dumping/parsing [ ]
2. rlv; relay [ ]
3. bell; camera [ ]
4. AO/HUD integration [ ]
5. subspy [ ]
6. safeword; runaway [ ]
7. resizer [ ]

Help us jot down that list!!

IMPORTANT: What we are working on here will be the final version of the OpenCollar as we know it. Those who will want to participate for 4.0 will have to be familiar with the old system and you all have now one more time the chance to take a look at it from the inside out together with us.
